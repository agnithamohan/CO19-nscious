# CO19-nscious

CO19-nscious or CoNscious as referred in some instances is a project we worked on during Pickhacks 2021. The objective of this project was to come up with a system of Corona consciousness metric that could provide transparency and enable communication for people who are or are in the vicinity of vulnerable population. 

The world can't stay shut forever, but in the process of repoening our doors, the general population may not fully observe regulations placed by the government. The only way one can assure the safety for themselves and their loved ones is to ensure they have the most complete information possible and this application hopes to serve as a communication platform that enables that.
